## Installation

To get started with ClaudePoint, you need to install it via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g claudepoint
```

This command installs the global package, allowing you to use ClaudePoint in any of your projects.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using ClaudePoint in your project. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

### Create a Checkpoint

To create a checkpoint of your current codebase, use:

```bash
claudepoint create
```

This command will save the current state of your code, allowing you to return to it later if needed.

### Restore a Checkpoint

If you need to revert to a previous checkpoint, run:

```bash
claudepoint restore [checkpoint-id]
```

Replace `[checkpoint-id]` with the ID of the checkpoint you want to restore.

### View Checkpoints

To see a list of all your checkpoints, use:

```bash
claudepoint list
```

This command will display all saved checkpoints along with their IDs and timestamps.

## Development History & Changelog

ClaudePoint automatically tracks all changes made to your codebase. You can view the development history by running:

```bash
claudepoint history
```

This command provides a comprehensive log of all actions taken within your project.

## Custom Changelog Entries

You can add custom entries to your changelog by using:

```bash
claudepoint log "Your message here"
```

This feature helps you document specific changes or milestones in your project.

## Smart Compression

ClaudePoint uses smart compression to store backups efficiently. This means that your storage space is optimized without sacrificing the integrity of your backups.

## Gitignore Awareness

ClaudePoint respects your `.gitignore` file. This means that any files or directories specified in `.gitignore` will not be included in the checkpoints, keeping your backups clean and relevant.

## Safe Restoration

Before restoring a checkpoint, ClaudePoint automatically creates a backup of your current code. This ensures that you never lose any important changes, even when reverting to an earlier state.

## Auto Cleanup

To keep your workspace organized, ClaudePoint features an auto cleanup option. This removes unnecessary files and backups, ensuring that your project remains tidy.
